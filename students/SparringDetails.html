                <div >
                    <P>Three step sparring is designed for the beginner to learn basic techniques. Three step teaches the student many things i.e. proper distance, correct facing, forearm conditioning, correct blocks, correct stances, counter attacks and timing. <BR>
                    There are a few basic rules which apply to all ten examples for both the attacker and defender. </P>
                    <P><span class="label label-info">The Attacker:</span><BR>
                    The attacker brings there right leg back into a walking stance and performs an obverse low section outer forearm block and Kihaps (to show they are ready). They then wait for the defender to Kihap (also to show they are ready), and walks forward (in walking stance) three times performing a middle section obverse punch on every move forward. <EM>This is the same for all 10 examples.</EM></P>
                    <P><span class="label label-info">The Defender:</span><BR>
                    The defenders start in parallel ready stance. When they are ready they Kihap, and the attacker will attack them with three middle section punches. The defender then then performs two or three blocks (depending on which number they do) and performs a counter attack. This<em> is also the same for all 10 examples.</em></P>

                <p>This form of sparring is designed as a step forward from basic three step sparring. It involves three consecutive attacks (hand or feet) and three blocks or evasions, plus a counter-attack. Three step semi-free sparring should not be hurried, the secret is reaction force and quick, intelligent movements. This is where the true art of sparring is learnt. </p>
                <p>Attacking students start in 'L' stance guarding block. </p>
                <p>Defending students start in parallel stance. </p>

                <h2 align="center">One for one Sparring</h2>
                <div class="well well-small">
                    <p>One for one may well be the first kind of sparring a student will have a chance to practise. Although it is mainly used for stamina and reaction speed training for all grades of students, it is often a good introduction to sparring for someone who has never had to fight before. This is because its turn-taking basis removes a lot of pressure from someone who is still trying to get to grips with techniques they have just started learning. In addition, they're not trying to 'score' against or 'beat' their opponent, and their opponent will not attack again until it is their turn. </p>
                    <p>The object is to return your technique as quickly as possible, and the opponent does likewise. For this reason, this exercise can be very physically demanding when done properly. </p>
                    <p>Both students start in fighting position, and when the command is given, one student will start with one technique, as soon as his technique is over, the other student attacks immediately, and so on. Because this is a stamina exercise, it does not mean that techniques should be sloppy, they should be crisp and well-executed. </p>

                <div class="well well-small">
                    <p>Free Sparring is basically putting what has been learnt so far into practise, with no prewarning of attack. Therefore, not as many defending techniques can be practised as in the other forms of sparring. </p>
                    <p>Semi contact sparring is allowed only with adequate protection (i.e., safety boots and gloves, etc.). This type of sparring must only be carried out under strick supervision of a qualified Instructor.</p>
